## 🌐 Routing Structure

The application uses React Router v6 with language-based routing:

- `/` → Automatically redirects to `/uz/`
- `/uz/` → Uzbek version of the site
- `/ru/` → Russian version of the site
- `/*` → Any invalid route redirects to `/uz/`

All internal navigation (menu items, buttons, links) automatically includes the language prefix. The language switcher updates the URL path while preserving the current section.

### SEO Benefits

- Each language has its own URL path for better search engine indexing
- Language-specific meta tags and structured data
- Proper `hreflang` tags for international SEO
- Canonical URLs for each language version
